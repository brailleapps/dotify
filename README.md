# Dotify
Dotify Braille Translation System is an open source Braille translator written in Java.  Dotify is designed for collaborative, open source braille software development.

## Features
Dotify delivers a unique set of abilities that, once combined, no other Braille production framework can offer today.

### Java Based
Dotify is a pure Java framework which makes it suitable for various applications including workstations, servers and embedded systems without changes to the code. Run on a server today and embed the same code in a device tomorrow.

### Designed for High-Volume, Automated Use
Dotify has been designed for high-volume, automated use from the very beginning, prioritizing reliability, speed and error free output over a "best effort" approach typically utilized in end-user systems.

### Designed for High Quality Braille
Dotify does not compromise with braille quality in order to fit a set of predetermined design restrictions. If a feature is required for a locale, we aim to make it possible to implement. Dotify does not tell you what good Braille should be like.

### Open Source
Dotify is Open Source, this means that everyone has the right to use it and change it.

### Modular
Dotify aims at a modular design of functional units that can be replaced or integrated into other solutions individually. The core components are compatible with both OSGi and SPI environments.

## Performance
About 10 seconds/book or 70 braille pages/second (based on a selection of novels, utilizing a single core of a modern PC and including JVM startup).
