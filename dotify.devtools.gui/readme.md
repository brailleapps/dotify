# Introduction #
The dotify.devtools.gui project in the code repository contains a GUI for testing various Dotify components in both an OSGi and an SPI environment.

This tool allows a user to
  * translate a text to braille interactively
  * get unicode code points for a string of characters or vice versa
  * convert braille p-notation into the corresponding unicode braille pattern (block 0x2800)
