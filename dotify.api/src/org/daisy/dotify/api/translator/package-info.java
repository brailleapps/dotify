/**
 * <p>
 * Provides a braille translation API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This package contains interfaces needed to transform text into braille.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The design allows hyphenation to be handled internally by the translator,
 * which enables support for non-standard hyphenation as well as line break
 * dependent braille markers, such as continuation signs etc.
