# Introduction #
dotify.common contains general classes that had to be implemented in order to support the other projects. If you want to use it, you can get it [here](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22dotify.common%22).

Adding classes to this project should not be taken lightly as infrastructure dependencies can cause problems if overused.
