<block>Digitization is rapidly changing the scene for publishing, distribution and accessibility. Within a short span of time the overall framework for intellectual rights, pricing and accessibility has been challenged and new perspectives emerge for right holders, user groups, manufacturers and other stakeholders.</block>

<block>The Future Publishing and Accessibility conference will highlight and encourage conversations surrounding the perspectives for the future of publishing and accessibility. Come and participate in discussions on the following topics:</block>
<block>Will the role of publishing companies, manufacturers and libraries change dramatically?</block>
