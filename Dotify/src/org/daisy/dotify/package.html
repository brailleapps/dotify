<p>Provides a transformer for converting XML to text. The transformer can
convert structural XML documents into text-oriented display formats, i.e.
formats that have a fixed width in characters per row. Focus has been on
braille, specifically braille books, therefore pages, sections and volumes have
been considered for the programming interfaces.</p>

<h3>Adding a new locale</h3>

<p>Adding a new locale requires some work, depending on your requirements. At
least the following items need to be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a new package in "org_pef_dtbook2pef.setups", for example "de_DE".
    All locale specific code should be stored here except text filters, see
    Adding a language below.</li>
  <li>Add your setup name to the "Setup" enum in TaskSystemFactory.</li>
  <li>Create a class that implements TaskSystem, and add to it the tasks that
    your locale needs, see below.</li>
  <li>Add your TaskSystem to TaskSystemFactory. Add the lines needed to the
    method called "newTaskSystem".</li>
  <li>Add a language, see below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementing TaskSystem</h3>

<p>A TaskSystem implementation should contain at least these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An input format to FLOW format conversion (comparable to XSL-FO), for
    example: 
    <p><code>setup.add(new XsltTask("DTBook to FLOW converter",
    dtbook2flowXsltUrl, null, xsltProps));</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>A FLOW format to a PagedMedia conversion, for example: 
    <p><code>setup.add(new LayoutEngineTask("FLOW to PEF converter", flow,
    paginator, paged));</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Refer to the sv_SE implementation for more information.</p>

<h3>Adding a language</h3>

<p>Braille tables are not kept in the "org_pef_dtbook2pef.setups" package, but
are a part of the "org_pef_dtbook2pef.system" package. The purpose of this is
to allow all locales to access each others rules, and optionally output braille
using that locale, even when using a setup in another language.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a table that follows the rules of UCharReplacer (for more
    information, see the <a
    href="int_daisy_unicodeTranscoder.html">int_daisy_unicodeTranscoder</a>
    documentation), and place it in a new package in the
    "org_pef_dtbook2pef.system.tasks.layout.text.brailleFilters" package, e.g
    "de_DE/de_DE.xml".<br />
    <em>If your locale has special requirements (such as contractions), this
    method cannot be used. In this case, another implementation must be
    created. If your class implements the StringFilter interface, the next step
    can still be applied.</em></li>
  <li>Add your locale to BrailleFilterFactory, by adding code to the
    newStringFilter method. Use existing code as an example of how to do this.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Customizing layout</h3>

<p>Page layout, such as headers and footers, as well as the interpretation of
elements in the input document are customized by writing a stylesheet for the
input format, so that the input document's contents is expressed using the FLOW
grammar. See "flow.dtd" in the "org_pef_dtbook2pef.system.tasks.layout.flow"
package for a description of this format.</p>

<p>If there exist an XSLT for the input format, it could be extended as defined
by XSLT. As a general guideline, it is ok to extend a stylesheet in
"setups.common". It is however, not recommended to extend another locale's
stylesheets. In this case, it is better to copy the stylesheet into your
locale's directory, and modify it.</p>

<h3>Running a new setup</h3>

<p>Before running a new setup, it must be added to the Pipeline framework
files, that is to say:</p>
<ul>
  <li>transformer.tdf<br />
    add the new enum entry from the "Setup" enum to the parameter "setup".</li>
  <li>task scripts<br />
    add the same enum entry to the script parameter "setup" in the appropriate
    script</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adding input formats</h3>

<p>Similarly to customizing layout, a new input format requires a translation
between the grammar in the input document and the grammar that the
LayoutEngineTask reads. This can typically be acheived by applying an XSLT
tailored for the task.</p>

<p>Detecting the input format can require some work. However, the
InputDetectorTaskSystem is specifically designed to aid the process of
selecting and executing the correct validation rules and stylesheet for a given
input document and locale. It can be inserted at the appropriate place in
another TaskSystem.</p>

<p>Add to InputDetectorTaskSystem the lines needed to support the new format,
e.g:</p>

<p><code>if (rootNS.equals("http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2005/dtbook/")
&amp;&amp; rootElement.equals("dtbook")) {</code><code>inputformat =
"dtbook.properties";</code><code>}</code></p>

<p>Choose a suitable name for the properties file, typically using the name of
the format, e.g. "html.properties".</p>

<p>Refer to the Javadoc for more information on how to customize the
InputDetectorTaskSystem for your locale.</p>

<h3>Adding output formats</h3>

<p>First, consider if your needs could be met by converting the PEF file to
your desired format using (or extending) the org_pef_text.pef2text transformer.
If not, add an output format by implementing "PagedMediaWriter". Put your
creation in the "org_pef_dtbook2pef.system.tasks.layout.writers" package. If
your output format requirements cannot be met by implementing
"PagedMediaWriter", please consider submitting a <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=134191&amp;atid=729302">feature
request</a>.</p>
