<p>Provides setup configurations for different combinations of locale and input/output format. 
A setup can be retrieved from the TaskSystemFactory.</p>
<p>Sub packages typically contain java classes or other files that shape the result.</p>

<p>Adding a new locale requires some work, depending on your requirements. At
least the following items need to be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add a new package in "org.daisy.dotify.setups", for example "de_DE".
    All locale specific code should be stored here except text filters, see
    Adding a language below.</li>
  <li>Create a class that implements TaskSystem, and add to it the tasks that
    your locale needs, see below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adding input formats and customizing layout</h3>
<p>Dotify only understands OBFL markup. Therefore, a new input format 
requires a translation between the grammar in the input document and OBFL. 
This can be achieved by applying an XSLT tailored for the task.</p>

<p>Page layout, such as headers and footers, as well as the interpretation of
elements in the input document are customized by writing a XSLT stylesheet so 
that the input document's contents is expressed using the OBFL
grammar. See http://code.google.com/p/obfl/ for a description of this format.</p>

<p>If there already exists an XSLT for the input format for another locale, the stylesheet
could be copied into the desired locale's directory and then modified. It is not 
recommended to extend another locale's stylesheets.</p>

<p>Detecting an XML input format is easy, thanks to the XMLInputManager. It is 
specifically designed to inject the correct validation rules and 
XSLT stylesheet for any XML-format and locale combination into the task chain.</p>

<p>Adding a new format involves the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modify the input_format_catalog.xml</li>
<li>Add a selector file in the folder hierarchy</li>
<li>Add the desired validation rules and style sheets in folder hierarchy</li>
</ol>

<p>1. Modifying the input format catalog involves adding an entry for the new format. The key must be the
root element of the format followed by '@' and the namespace of the root
element. The value for this key should be a short but descriptive filename
for the format. Typically, the root element followed by '.properties' will 
suffice as filename. However, the filename must be unique throughout the file,
so another name may have to be chosen.</p>

<p>2. Add a selector file into the folder hierarchy in the appropriate
location of the folder hierarchy. The location of the selector file is subject to change, 
and is therefore not documented here. The selector file should contain two entries:
a path to the validation file and a path to the transformation file (relative to the
root folder of the locale).</p>

<p>3. Add the desired validation and stylesheets files to the folder hierarchy as 
indicated by the selector file.</p>

<h3>Implementing TaskSystem</h3>

<p> The task system implementation 
is responsible for setting up the LayoutEngineTask for the locale and adding post processing tasks (if needed).
A TaskSystem implementation should contain at least one step:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A OBFL format to a PagedMedia conversion, for example: 
    <p><code>setup.add(new LayoutEngineTask("OBFL to PEF converter", flow,
    paginator, paged));</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>
